*This template is a suggestion that may not fit your issue: delete/modify anything!*

**Short description of what you'd like added:**
*Describe briefly how you think stdpopsim could be better.*

**Rationale and considerations:**
*Give some more explanation of why this is a good idea,
and what considerations there are in implementing it.
For instance: if you're suggesting that a new species, model, or map is added
then say who'd use the resource.
Or, if you're suggesting a new method in the API,
talk through the proposed arguments to the method and outputs.*
