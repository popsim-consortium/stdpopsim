# TODO:
# It's not yet clear where this code should be put, nor how the API(s) should
# be structured.  The ``ext`` module is a temporary namespace for experimental
# extensions to stdpopsim.  It will probably disappear in the future.  The
# interfaces defined here are incomplete, engine specific, and are subject
# to change.
