    Return deleterious and beneficial MutationType()s representing a drosophila DFE

    DFE parameters are given in Table S1, with deleterious mutations drawn from a
    log-normal distribution and a point mass of positive selection. The DFE was
    inferred assuming synonymous variants are neutral and a relative mutation
    rate ratio of 2.5 nonsynonymous to 1 synonymous mutation. Results are given as
    scaled parameters, so that S = 2*N*s, so an estimate of Ne is required to
    convert the scaled selection coefficients to unscaled coefficients. Because the
    original study did not report an estimated effective population size, we use
    the estimate from Huber et al. (2017) of Ne=2.8e6, which was estimated from
    observed genome-wide synonymous mutation diversity and assuming a mutation rate
    of 3e-9.
