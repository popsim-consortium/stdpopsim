description: 'South Middle Atlas African three epoch model

  Model estimated from site frequency spectrum of synonymous SNPs from African (South
  Middle Atlas) samples using Williamson et al. 2005 methodology. Values come from
  supplementary table 1 of Huber et al 2018. Sizes change from N_A -> N_2 -> N_3 and
  t_2 is the time of the second epoch and t_3 is the time of the 3rd epoch.'
