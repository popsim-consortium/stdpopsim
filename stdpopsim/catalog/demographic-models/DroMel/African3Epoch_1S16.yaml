description: 'Three epoch African population

  The three epoch (modern, bottleneck, ancestral) model estimated for a single African
  Drosophila Melanogaster population from Sheehan and Song (2016). Population sizes
  are estimated by a deep learning model trained on simulation data. NOTE: Due to
  differences in coalescence units between PSMC (2N) and msms (4N) the number of generations
  were doubled from PSMC estimates when simulating data from msms in the original
  publication. We have faithfully represented the published model here.'
