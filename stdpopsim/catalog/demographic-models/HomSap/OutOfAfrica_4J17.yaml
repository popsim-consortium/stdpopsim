description: '4 population out of Africa

  Demographic model for a four population out-of-Africa history, taken from Jouganous
  et al. (2017). Parameter values were taken from table 4 in the main text. This model
  was fit based on joint allele frequecy spectrum (AFS) data from 1000 Genomes exomes
  from the YRI, CEU, CHB, and JPT poulation samples. The demography follows the previous
  three- populations out-of-Africa models with an additional population split in Asia
  leading to the Japanese (JPT) population. Parameter values were estimated with the
  program Moments assuming a mutation rate of 1.44e-8 and a generation time of 29
  years.'
