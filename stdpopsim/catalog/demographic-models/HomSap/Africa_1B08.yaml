description: 'African-americans population

  African-American two-epoch instantaneous growth model from Boyko et al 2008, fit
  to the synonymous SFS for the 11 of 15 African Americans showing the least European
  ancestry, using coalescent simulations with recombination with the maximum likelihood
  method of Williamson et al 2005; times were calibrated assuming 3e5 generations
  since human-chimp divergence and fitting the number of synonymous human-chimp differences.
  Mutation and recombination rates were assumed to be the same (1.8e-8).'
