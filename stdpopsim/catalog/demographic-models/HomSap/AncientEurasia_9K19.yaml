description: 'Multi-population model of ancient Eurasia

  This is the best-fitting model of a history of multiple ancient and present-day
  human populations sampled across Eurasia over the past 120,000 years. The fitting
  was performed using momi2 (Kamm et al. 2019), which uses the multi-population site-frequency
  spectrum as input data. The model includes a ghost admixture event (from unsampled
  basal Eurasians into early European farmers), and two admixture events where the
  source is approximately well-known (from Neanderthals into Non-Africans and from
  Western European hunter-gatherers into modern Sardinians. There are three present-day
  populations: Sardinians, Han Chinese and African Mbuti. Additionally, there are
  several ancient samples obtained from fossils dated at different times in the past:
  the Altai Neanderthal (Prufer et al. 2014), a Mesolithic hunter- gatherer (Lazaridis
  et al. 2014), a Neolithic early European sample (Lazaridis et al. 2014), and two
  Palaeolithic modern humans from Siberia - MA1 (Raghavan et al. 2014) and  Ust''Ishim
  (Fu et al. 2014). All the ancient samples are represented by a single diploid genome.'
