description: 'American admixture

  Demographic model for American admixture, taken from Browning et al. 2011. This
  model extends the Gravel et al. (2011) model of African/European/Asian demographic
  history to simulate an admixed population with admixture occurring 12 generations
  ago. The admixed population had an initial size of 30,000 and grew at a rate of
  5% per generation, with 1/6 of the population of African ancestry, 1/3 European,
  and 1/2 Asian. Note that this demographic model was not inferred, and the mutation
  rate that Browning et al. used for simulation is smaller than used for inferring
  the model, so the mutation rate provided here is that from Gravel et al.'
