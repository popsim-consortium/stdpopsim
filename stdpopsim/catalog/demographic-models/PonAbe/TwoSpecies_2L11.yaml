description: 'Two population orangutan model

  The two orang-utan species, Sumatran (Pongo abelii) and Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus)
  inferred from the joint-site frequency spectrum with ten individuals from each population.
  This model is an isolation-with- migration model, with exponential growth or decay
  in each population after the split. The Sumatran population grows in size, while
  the Bornean population slightly declines.'
