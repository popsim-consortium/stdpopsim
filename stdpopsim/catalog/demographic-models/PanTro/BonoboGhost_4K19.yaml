description: 'Ghost admixture into bonobos

  Demographic model of ghost admixture into bonobos from Kuhlwilm et al. (2019) Supplementary
  Table S2.2 column I and Table S3. This model simulates four populations: western
  chimpanzees, central chimpanzees, bonobos, and a extinct ghost lineage. The ghost
  admixture event is modelled as a 2% pulse from the ghost lineage to bonobos. Migration
  events among western chimpanzees, central chimpanzees, and bonobos are modelled
  as single generation pulses. Populatio size changes are also modelled.'
