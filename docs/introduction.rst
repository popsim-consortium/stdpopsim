    you would like to help, please open an issue or pull request at
    `GitHub <https://github.com/popgensims/stdpopsim>`_.

This is the documentation for ``stdpopsim``, the standard library for population
genetic simulation models.

We designed ``stdpopsim`` to make it easier for you to run reproducible, bug-free
simulations of genetic datasets from published demographic histories.
Under the hood, ``stdpopsim`` relies on
`msprime <https://tskit.dev/software/msprime.html>`_ and
`SLiM 4 <https://messerlab.org/slim/>`_ to generate sample datasets in the
`tree sequence <https://tskit.dev/learn/>`_ format.


First steps
-----------

 - Head to the :ref:`Installation <sec_installation>` page to get ``stdpopsim`` installed
   on your computer.

 - Skim the :ref:`Catalog <sec_catalog>` to see what simulations are currently supported
   by ``stdpopsim``.

 - Read the :ref:`Tutorials <sec_tutorial>` to see some examples of ``stdpopsim`` in
   action.


Getting involved
----------------

``stdpopsim`` **is a community effort, and we welcome YOU to join us!**

Are there other features, models or organisms that you'd like to see in ``stdpopsim``?
This software is maintained by the PopSim Consortium,
an open, global community of scientists and developers who are working together to improve
standards for benchmarking and testing in population genetics.
You can get into contact with the ``stdpopsim`` community by subscribing to our `email list
serve <https://lists.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/popgen_benchmark>`_
and by creating and commenting on
Github `issues <http://github.com/popgensims/stdpopsim/issues>`_.
There is a lot of chatter through
Github, and we’ve been building code
there cooperatively. If you are interested in joining us please read our
`code of conduct <https://github.com/popsim-consortium/stdpopsim/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.
A particular goal of this project is to build a diverse and supportive community,
and so we especially encourage individuals from underrepresented groups in popgen to join.
A primary goal of PopSim Consortium is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors,
with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
Being a member of the Consortium can provide a valuable avenue for career development, through
building networks, contributing to papers and code, as well as through learning programing standards
and best practices.
