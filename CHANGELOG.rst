--------------------
[0.2.1] - 2023-XX-XX
--------------------

**Breaking changes**:

- To add the possibility for a relationship between dominance and selection
    coefficient, now each stdpopsim MutationType might have more than one
    underlying SLiM mutation type; so, where this is recorded in top-level
    metadata (under `ts.metadata["stdpopsim"]["DFEs"]`) is now a list
    instead of a single value. This will not affect anyone who is not
    parsing the metadata related to DFEs.

**New features**:

- *Relationship between dominance and selection coefficient:*
    Added the `dominance_coeff_list` argument to `MutationType`, allowing
    for DFEs with a discretized relationship between h and s.
    (:user:`petrelharp`, :pr:`1498`)

**New species**:

- Mus musculus (:user:`peterdfields`, :pr:`1437`).
  QC'd by :user:`igronau`, :pr:`1454`.

--------------------
[0.2.0] - 2022-11-01
--------------------

Major feature release adding many new species and models, as well as support
for simulating selection via SLiM.

**Bug fixes**:

- Parameters in the HomSap/Zigzag_1S14 model now match those in Schiffels &
  Durbin (2014) (:user:`grahamgower`, :pr:`750`).

  (:user:`izabelcavassim`, :pr:`1092`).

  calculated (:user:`nspope`, :pr:`1345`).

**Breaking changes**:

  species/chromosome ploidy.  The old API for specifying haploid samples via
  population index has been retained, but is deprecated and will be
  removed at some point (:user:`nspope`, :pr:`1361`).

--------------------
[0.1.2] - 2020-05-29
--------------------

Important bugfix and feature release, recommended for all users.

Significant errors in the HomSap/OutOfAfrica_3G09 and HomSap/OutOfAfrica_2T12
models have been fixed. **We recommend repeating any analyses performed using
these models**. See `here
<https://github.com/jeromekelleher/msprime-model-errors>`__ for more details on
the error in the three population Out of Africa model and analysis of the
differences from the correct model.

The recombination rate for AraTha was also off by a factor of 10.
**We recommend repeating any analyses performed using this species**.

**Bug fixes**:

- Fix error in HomSap/OutOfAfrica_3G09 model, in which migration between
  ancestral African and European populations was allowed to continue in the
  most ancient time period (:user:`apragsdale`, :pr:`496`, :issue:`516`).

- Fix similar error in HomSap/OutOfAfrica_2T12 model
  (:user:`ndukler`, :pr:`520`, :issue:`516`).

- Fix recombination rate estimate for AraTha (:user:`grahamgower`,
  :issue:`537`, :pr:`527`), which was off by a factor of 10.

- Require attrs >=19.10 (:user:`grahamgower`, :pr:`399`, :issue:`394`)

  (:user:`grahamgower`, :pr:`477`, :issue:`471`).

- Various documentation and citation improvements.

**Breaking changes**:

- Move the --quiet/-q command line option to the top-level. Previously
  we would write ``stdpopsim HomSap -q 10`` whereas we now write
  ``stdpopsim -q HomSap``. (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :issue:`515`, :pr:`547`)

- The long form ``--verbosity`` argument has been changed to ``--verbose``
  (:pr:`547`).
